# PropertyTracker

A real estate listing monitor built in Python. PropertyTracker scrapes apartment listings from [Portal Inmobiliario](https://www.portalinmobiliario.com) (Chile's largest real estate marketplace, owned by MercadoLibre), maintains a historical dataset of listings and prices, and detects newly published properties and price changes over time.

The long-term goal is to use this growing dataset to **detect personal real estate investment opportunities**: undervalued listings, price drops, and neighborhoods trending above or below their historical price per m².

## How it works

Each run:

* Scrapes all search result pages for the configured searches (no browser needed — the site embeds structured JSON in its HTML)
* Compares against the stored dataset by listing ID
* Reports **truly new listings** and **price changes** since the last run
* Tracks `first_seen_date`, `last_seen_date` and `first_seen_price` per listing
* Stores the full history in `data/raw/portalinmobiliario_listings.csv`
* Exports listings discovered in the last 7 days to `data/recent_listings.csv`

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The exact publication date is not public on the site, so `first_seen_date` approximates it with one-day precision when the tracker runs daily — building a timestamped dataset that doesn't exist anywhere else.

## Data captured

Per listing: title, price (UF or CLP), bedrooms, bathrooms, usable m², **UF per m²** (computed), location, property kind (used / new development), seller, URL, and first/last seen dates.

## Roadmap: ML for investment opportunity detection

The dataset this tracker accumulates is designed to feed machine learning models:

* **Price modeling** — regression models (hedonic pricing) to estimate the expected price of a listing from its attributes (m², bedrooms, neighborhood, floor, building age), flagging listings priced significantly below their prediction as potential opportunities
* **Time-on-market signals** — using `first_seen` / `last_seen` history to estimate how fast comparable properties sell, and which price cuts precede a sale
* **Neighborhood trends** — tracking median UF/m² per neighborhood over time to detect areas appreciating faster than the comuna average
* **Anomaly detection** — unsupervised methods to surface listings that deviate from their cluster of comparables

## Configuration

Searches are defined in `scrapers/portalinmobiliario.py` (`SEARCHES`). To add rentals or other comunas:

```python
SEARCHES = [
    {"operation": "venta", "property_type": "departamento", "location": "providencia-metropolitana"},
    {"operation": "arriendo", "property_type": "departamento", "location": "providencia-metropolitana"},
]
```

The `location` slug is the one that appears in the site URL when searching for a comuna.

## Notes

* Paid placements (`is_pad`) are excluded: they often belong to other comunas and duplicate organic results
* For new developments, m² comes as a range, so `uf_per_m2` is only computed for listings with a single m² value
* One daily run with a 1-second pause between pages (~70 requests) keeps the load on the site respectful

## Status

Active personal project focused on real estate data collection, price tracking, and investment opportunity modeling.
